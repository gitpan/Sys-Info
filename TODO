* Unified file system information
    - Add a database to ::Base to query fs meta data
    - Return FS information for all available partitions.
* Add new devices
    - BIOS -> Easy on Windows through WMI
    - Optical
    - PCI
    - VGA
    - Other?
* Can there be improvements on the current user detection?
* CPU flags on non-Linux OS
    - Windows & BSD are currently lacking this. BSD seem to have /proc support
        but not intalled by default. So, unreliable.
* MacOSX Driver
    - I don't own a Mac. If anyone wants to Work on that, just create
        Sys::Info::Driver::MacOSX and ping me so that I can enable that
        driver in the os detector "OSID".
* Improve BSD driver
    - I'm testing this on DesktopBSD. Needs to be tested on others as well.
* CPU
    - bitness() not implemented in BSD & Unknown
* OS
    - bitness() not implemented in BSD & Unknown
